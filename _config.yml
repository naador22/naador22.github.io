user_description: The movie Three Idiots piqued my interest when I was a student of 9th grade. This went on for long enough for me to complete an engineering degree. Iâ€™m an Industrial & Production Engineer from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST). Here, I learnt how engineering and business can be molded into a single cavity. Through the PTAK & business competition, I began to understand about supply chain. Furthermore, I was always fascinated by how an organization worked from start until the end. It eventually lead me down several rabbit holes, and I soon discovered an entirely different universe in this sector. So now I'm doing my best to achieve the excellence and learn the nuts and bolts; there is to know about it.
